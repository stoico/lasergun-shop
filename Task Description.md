# Task description:
## Features:
  - At this url http://private-5815fe-recommendationsknip.apiary-mock.com/products you can find a JSON response with the list of products.
  - Your task is to create a small, one page web application which has two views (use create-react-app for starting a project or create your own)
  - The first view displays a list of the products with a title, one image (thumbnail) and a price.
  - The second displays a title, description, specification, price and product images.
  - Product Images should be displayed as a small gallery, you should use “original” property to display large/selected image. Please implement this in a simple way, without using an external library.
  - *Bonus (optional): Implement a feature allowing users to add comments for each of the products. The comments shouldn’t be sent to to a back-end server; it is enough to have them saved in local storage and displayed on the single product page.
## Requirements:
  Appropriate use of React and Redux.
